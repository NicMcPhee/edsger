edsger Parser Grammar
======================

edsger uses [PEG.js](http://pegjs.majda.cz/) to build its parser grammar, a PEG based parser generator for JavaScript.

To be honest I've done most of the development so far using [the nice on-line PEG.js tool](http://pegjs.majda.cz/online). Not the most efficient in the long run, but it let me quickly spike the tool and the necessary grammar logic so I could decide if this project was even feasible. Down the road I'll need to automate more of the management of the JavaScript file generated by PEG.js, but this has worked for now. If you want information on installation and how someone else has pseudo-automated the process, checkout out [the JsSIP project](https://github.com/versatica/JsSIP/tree/master/src/grammar).
